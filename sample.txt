Gemini API File Search is a powerful RAG system provided by Google.
It allows developers to upload documents and perform semantic search without managing a vector database.
The pricing model is interesting: storage is free, and query-time embeddings are free.
You only pay for the initial indexing.
This makes it a cost-effective solution for building RAG applications.
The API handles chunking, embedding, and retrieval automatically.
